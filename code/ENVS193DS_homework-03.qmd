| **Table 1: Comparison of Regression Models**. This table shows the five regression models used to predict total biomass (g): "Null," "Model 1," "Model 2," "Model 3," and "Model 4." Each column is a seperate model. The header row indicates the predictor variable in question and check marks in the rows indicate that predictor variable was used in the model.  |

### b. Statistical Methods

To examine the influence of specific leaf area (mm^2^/g), watering level (well watered vs drought stressed, and species type on total biomass, I compared the five models outlined in the table above in order to determine which predictor variables best influence total biomass. I used the `model.sel` function from the `MuMIn` package which uses corrected (for smaller sample size) Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) to rank the provided models according to their AICc values. Model 4, which looks at total biomass as a function of water treatment and species, has the lowest AICc value (-156.2) and highest weight (0.772), indicating it is the best model among those compared. To evaluate linear model assumptions, I used the `plot` for each model to evaluate the diagnostic plots for residuals vs fitted values, the Normal Q-Q plot, the Scale-Location plot, and the residuals vs. leverage plot. These visual checks confirmed the models were homoscedastic, normally distributed, and linear.

### c. Visualization

```{r}
#first read in model I am using
model4 <- lm(total_g ~ water_treatment + species_name, #formula
             data = drought_exp_clean) #dataframe
#then need to get model prediction values
model_preds <- ggpredict(model4, #using model 4
                         terms = c("water_treatment", #predictor terms within model 4
                                   "species_name"))
```

```{r}
#make new dataframe 
model_preds_for_plotting <- model_preds %>%  #make a new df from the model predictions df
  rename(water_treatment = x, # renaming columns to make them match drought_exp_clean names
         species_name = group)
ggplot() +
# underlying data
  geom_point(data = drought_exp_clean, #using the clean data
             aes(x = water_treatment, # x axis is water treatment
                 y = total_g, #y axis is total biomass 
                 color = water_treatment), #color the points based on water treatment
             alpha = 0.25)+ #make the underlying points more transparent
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#C4A484", "#228B22"))+  # Specify colors for each group

#model data
   geom_point(data = model_preds_for_plotting, #using dataframe I made above
             aes(x = water_treatment, # x axis is water treatment
                 y = predicted, #y axis is predicted total biomass (g)
                 color = water_treatment), #color based on water treatment 
             size = 2.5,  # Making model prediction points larger for visibility
             shape = 17) +  # Changing shape to triangle for better differentiation
  # Cleaner theme
  theme_classic() +

  # Add labels 
  labs(x = "Water Treatment", y = "Total Biomass (mm2/g)", title = "Model Predictions vs. Data by Species and Watering Conditions") +
  
# Remove legend
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  
# Creating different panels for species
  facet_wrap(~species_name)
```

**Figure 1: Well-watered plants tend to have higher total biomass than drought stressed plants.** The above graph shows differences in total plant biomass between different water treatment types and species. The lighter circular points indicate underlying data while the triangular points indicate the model prediction values for each group. Among all species, well watered groups have higher predicted biomass than drought-stressed groups. Species type also influences predicted total biomass.

### e. Results

Based on Akaike Information Criterion, water treatment and plant species are the predictors that best describe total mass (AICc = -156.2). These set of predictors were used in model 4, which was then used to perform a multiple linear regression. This regression indicated both species and water treatment type predict total biomass (g) (F (7,62) = 27.08, p \<0.001, a = 0.05, adjusted R2 = 0.7257). Across species type, plants that were well-watered had a total mass that was 0.12 (+-0.017) grams higher than drought-stressed plants. Across water treatments, *Grindelia camporum* showed the largest positive difference (+0.31; +- 0.032 grams, p \<0.001, a = 0.05) in total mass compared to the baseline species *Acmispon glaber*. Other species like *Encelia californica*, *Eschscholzia californica*, and *Nasella pulchra* also had significantly (p \< 0.001) higher total mass, while *Penstemon centranthifolius* did not show a statistically significant difference (p = 0.13).

## **Problem 2. Affective visualization**

### a. Affective Visualization for My Data

My data is all about tracking how my new skincare routine is affecting the number of breakouts on my face. I think a really cool data visualization I could do would be a photo collage/slideshow showing the progression of my skin since I started the treatment the day I started collecting data. I, however, did not take photos of my face every day, so instead I think I could pair some photos that I do have with the data that I collected on a graph for a blended visualization.
